# SpringBatchUsingEmployeeData
This project demonstrates how to use **Spring Batch 5.0** for batch processing in a Spring Boot application. The application reads employee data from a CSV file (`EmployeeData.csv`), processes each record, and stores the data into a database using Spring Data JPA. The batch job can be triggered via a REST API endpoint, making it easy to import employee data into the system.

With this setup, you can efficiently process large sets of data, such as employee records, in a production-grade manner with error handling, transaction management, and performance optimizations provided by Spring Batch.
