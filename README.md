## **SpringBatchUsingEmployeeData**
This project demonstrates how to use **Spring Batch 5.0** for batch processing in a Spring Boot application. The application reads employee data from a CSV file (`EmployeeData.csv`), processes each record, and stores the data into a database using Spring Data JPA. The batch job can be triggered via a REST API endpoint, making it easy to import employee data into the system.

With this setup, you can efficiently process large sets of data, such as employee records, in a production-grade manner with error handling, transaction management, and performance optimizations provided by Spring Batch.

## **Application Configuration**

- **Employee Entity**: Represents the data structure of the employee being processed.
- **EmployeeRepo**: Interface extending `JpaRepository` for CRUD operations on `Employee` data.
- **Spring Batch Job**: Configures the `FlatFileItemReader`, custom `EmployeeProcessor`, and `RepositoryItemWriter`.

___

## **Batch Job Flow**

The job follows this process:

1. **Reader** (`FlatFileItemReader`): Reads data from `EmployeeData.csv` located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2. **Processor** (`EmployeeProcessor`): Processes each employee record, potentially transforming or validating the data.
3. **Writer** (`RepositoryItemWriter`): Writes the processed data to the database using the `EmployeeRepo`.
